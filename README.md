# dotfiles

Here are some of my dotfile configurations for git and vim.

## Installation

1 - Drop these dotfiles in your home directory just by doing:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dciccale/dotfiles.git ~/
```


2 - I use vundle for plugin management, so clone it, only need to do this once:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git ~/.vim/bundle/vundle
```


3 - Open vim and run the following command to install all the used plugins:

```
:BundleInstall
```
